    # The following looks rather insane and I've sent numerous hours trying
    # to figure it out. The problem is that if grep gets called with the
    # block, for example:
    #
    #    [].methods.grep(/(.+?)_by/) { $1.to_sym }
    #
    # ...then simple:
    #
    #    original_grep(pattern, &blk)
    #
    # doesn't set $1 within the grep block which causes nil.to_sym failure.
    # The workaround below has been tested with Ruby 1.8.7/Rails 2.3.8 and
    # Ruby 1.9.2/Rails 3.0.0. For more info see the following thread dating
    # back to 2003 when Ruby 1.8.0 was as fresh off the grill as Ruby 1.9.2
    # is in 2010 :-)
